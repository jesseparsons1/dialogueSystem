# dialogueSystem
I wanted to create a simple framework to speed up creating dialogue in my Unity games, similar in style what you see in games like Fire Emblem. This is by no means a finished system and is still a WIP, but thought I'd share it here nonetheless. Hopefully somebody finds it useful!

Requires Unity's TextMesh Pro!

Check out the demo scene for an example of how it works, but it is safe to delete everything inside the Dialogue System Demo folder once you no longer need the demo.
